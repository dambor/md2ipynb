## Summary
This Python script can be used to convert a Markdown file to a Jupyter Notebook file. To use it, simply run the `convert.py` script from the command line, passing in the path to your input Markdown file and the path where you want to save your output Jupyter Notebook file. If you have any issues or questions, feel free to reach out to the script author or open an issue on the GitHub repository.


* Python 3.6 or higher* `pypandoc` and `nbformat` librariesYou can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install pypandoc nbformat

```
## Usage
To use this script, simply run it from the command line and pass in the path to your input Markdown file and the path where you want to save your output Jupyter Notebook file. Here's the basic command format:
```sh
python convert.py <input-file> <output-file>

```
Replace `<input-file>` and `<output-file>` with the file paths to your own input and output files.
For example, if you have a Markdown file named `my-markdown-file.md` in the same directory as the `convert.py` script, and you want to save the output Jupyter Notebook file as `my-notebook.ipynb`, you can use the following command:
```sh
python convert.py my-markdown-file.md my-notebook.ipynb

```
## Script
Here's the full Python script:
```python
import argparse
import pypandoc
import nbformat


def convert_to_ipynb(input_file, output_file):
    """
    Converts a Markdown file to a Jupyter Notebook file using pypandoc and nbformat.
    """
    # Convert the Markdown file to a Jupyter Notebook object
    markdown = pypandoc.convert_file(input_file, "ipynb", outputfile=output_file)

    # Save the Jupyter Notebook object to a file
    nbformat.write(markdown, output_file)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create the command-line interface
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Convert a Markdown file to a Jupyter Notebook file.")
    parser.add_argument("input_file", help="the input Markdown file path")
    parser.add_argument("output_file", help="the output Jupyter Notebook file path")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Convert the input file to a Jupyter Notebook file
    convert_to_ipynb(args.input_file, args.output_file)

```
