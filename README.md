# Markdown2Ipynb

Here's a Python script that converts a Markdown file to a Jupyter Notebook file, along with full documentation on how to run it.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher* `pypandoc` and `nbformat` librariesYou can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install pypandoc nbformat

```

## Usage
To use this script, simply run it from the command line and pass in the path to your input Markdown file and the path where you want to save your output Jupyter Notebook file. Here's the basic command format:
```sh
python convert.py <input-file> <output-file>

```
Replace `<input-file>` and `<output-file>` with the file paths to your own input and output files.
For example, if you have a Markdown file named `my-markdown-file.md` in the same directory as the `convert.py` script, and you want to save the output Jupyter Notebook file as `my-notebook.ipynb`, you can use the following command:
```sh
python convert.py my-markdown-file.md my-notebook.ipynb

```
## Summary
This Python script can be used to convert a Markdown file to a Jupyter Notebook file. To use it, simply run the `convert.py` script from the command line, passing in the path to your input Markdown file and the path where you want to save your output Jupyter Notebook file. If you have any issues or questions, feel free to reach out to the script author or open an issue on the GitHub repository.
